**Problems with RestAPI:
-- Over fetching: get more information from the server than the
    information you asked for.
    --> with graph -- we get what we described

-- Under Fetching: have to make other requests to accomplish one thing right.
    --> with graph - need only one query.

-- install three packages: 
$npm install babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-3 --save-dev
/.babelrc:
{
    "presets": ["env", "stage-3"]
}

**********************************
schema: description of the data is going to be sent or want to retrieve.

mutate: when we make a operation that changes the data.
query: when we get data - make post request - (data is in the body)
